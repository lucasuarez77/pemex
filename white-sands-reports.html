45-31 - White Sands, NM - Glass Shards Raining From Above</p>

<p>Location: Alkali Flats Trail</p>

<p>A group of teenagers trespassing in the southern sector of the Zone of Cooperative 
Use (ZCU) reported being struck by small shards of grayish-green glass which appeared 
to be falling from the sky at random. A vehicle was spotted by park rangers departing 
the area at a high rate of speed after sustaining multiple impacts to the roof. The 
driver was later found deceased behind the wheel following a fatal head injury. No 
additional injuries were reported at the scene. The area was secured by rangers a few 
hours later, and the park is contacting local law enforcement authorities to apprise 
the situation. Park ranger David Evans is leading the investigation.

45-51 - Socorro, NM - Atmospheric Phenomenon Caused By Explosion</p>

<p>Location: Rio Grande Valley</p>

<p>On the morning of July 16, numerous residents in the city of Socorro reported seeing
a disorienting flash of light appear on the western horizon, followed by the sound of a 
massive explosion from above. A local press report covering the incident claimed that the 
flash was so bright, even a blind girl living in the region was able to perceive it. A 
few hours later, “strange white flakes” began to fall from the sky, which many children 
in the area believed to be snow despite the summer weather. Local authorities explained 
that the phenomenon was the result of a nearby ammunition magazine explosion “containing 
a considerable amount of high explosives and pyrotechnics.” Despite residents insisting 
upon the appearance of "two fiery blue and orange columns extending into the sky," there 
had been no loss of life or injury, and all dissidents were swiftly silenced.

45-76 - White Sands, NM - Suicide Victim Disovered</p>

<p>Location: Dunes Drive</p>

<p>At approximately 13:30, Ranger Garry Olson was notified that Ranger David Evans had 
gone radio silent for over 3 hours in the Alkali Flats region of the park. Ranger Greg 
Kouns and facility manager Johnwill Faris also responded. Since afternoon temperatures 
were in the mid-90s, the park sought assistance from the 48th Rescue Squadron at Holloman 
AFB. Ranger Jonathan Brotzman worked from the rescue helicopter, while Ranger Paul Jones 
and a Border Patrol agent followed Evans’ windblown tracks. Following an intensive search 
lasting nearly 2 hours, Evans' body was found just over a mile southeast of Dunes Drive 
and nearly two miles south of his vehicle. He had died from two self-inflicted gunshot 
wounds to the head, and a 12-gauge shotgun was found at his feet. Investigation led to 
the discovery that Evans had been depressed and had been reported missing two days prior 
by his wife, who had found a suicide note in his dresser. A second suicide note was found 
in his vehicle, along with a fanny pack containing various documents in Evans’ name. 
There was no evidence of foul play in the area where his remains were found. The state 
medical investigator has not responded to requests for an autopsy to be performed.

45-31A - White Sands, NM - Follow-up on Raining Glass Shards</p>

<p>Location: Alkali Flats Trail</p>
		
<p>After conferring with Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Robert E. Hermes and 
independent investigator William Strickfaden, federal investigators concluded the foreign 
objects to be chunks of “trinitite” (also known as atomsite or Alamogordo glass) forged 
from the extreme heat of the nearby Trinity Test conducted at 05:29 Mountain War Time 
on July 16, 1945. This information remained highly classified until a recent press release 
by President Harry S. Truman acknowledged the experiment’s existence and allowed the case 
to be reevaluated by authorities. The glass itself mostly consists of melted sand which was 
drawn up into the fireball of the initial explosion and fused with various fragments of the 
bomb’s metal support structure, such as copper wiring and steel rivets. Further details have 
yet to be disclosed. [Forrest M. Benson Jr., WHSA, 8/7]</p>

46-29 - White Sands, NM - Unknown Trespasser Detained</p>

<p>Location: Parabolic Dunes</p>

<p>Early in the morning at around 04:58, a park ranger travelling north from Lake Lucero 
observed an unusually tall man in a wide-brimmed hat attempting to enter the White Sands 
Missile Range (WSMR) from the Parabolic Dunes. The ranger called for backup before intercepting 
the individual and ordering him to stop. He informed the man that he was currently trespassing 
on restricted federal property and could possibly face $500 in fines and up to 6 months in 
prison if he failed to comply. The subject inquired about his “Miranda Rights” and mentioned 
something about an alleged missile crash south of the border. Subsequent inquiry into this event 
found no evidence supporting his claims. The subject was detained and taken into custody by Ranger 
Eugene Ibarra at 05:23 with minimal resistance. He was interrogated at a nearby Border Patrol 
checkpoint on Highway 70 by Ranger Kenneth Lee and Ranger Paul Jones. The subject was clearly 
deranged, convinced that the year was 1966 and speaking at length about events that have not yet 
transpired or had already occurred, such as the massacre of rebels in the “zócalo” of Mexico City, 
the detonation of a ”radioactive doomsday device” off the coast of Campeche, and the impending 
assassination of recently elected Congressman John F. Kennedy. He refused to provide his name or 
any forms of identification to law enforcement officials. After nearly 5 hours in police custody, 
he stated that he felt “the molecules of [his] consciousness rearranging” before spontaneously 
combusting and releasing an intense burst of light that temporarily blinded both rangers present. 
Full transcription of the interview will be provided upon request. [K. Lee, WHSA, 7/16]</p>

93-172 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search</p>

<p>On April 2nd, K.M. hiked into the dunes around noon to join a
companion.  When she failed to show up and did not return at dusk, the park
was notified and a search was begun.  K.M. was wearing shorts, a tank top
and a cap, but was barefoot.  The search ended just after midnight when a
very sore-footed K.M. walked into Ratscat, a secure military facility on
the White Sands missile range about eight miles north of the point last
seen.  K.M. was detained by military security for extensive debriefings
and was not released to rangers until 2:30 a.m.  K.M. said that she became
disoriented in the dunes and wandered until she saw the lights of the
Ratscat facility.  [Robert Appling, WHSA, 4/8]</p>

93-229 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Special Event</p>

<p>On Sunday, April 25th, the annual "Days in the Sand" beach party, which is
sponsored by a local radio station and nightspot, was held in the park.  An
area on the Loop Road in the heart of the dunes was blocked off for a remote
radio station, volleyball courts and the display of vehicles from a low-
riders mini-truck club and a drag car club.  Free soft drinks, water and hot
dogs were provided.  Large caravans of cars began entering the park at 8
a.m. to stake-out viewing areas on the dunes near the event.  By 10 a.m.,
traffic into the park and dune area was heavy, and the associated congestion
resulted in many unsafe vehicle operation violations.  The unexpectedly good
weather led to larger crowds than originally anticipated; many alcohol and
driving violations could not be cited due to insufficient law enforcement
personnel (three rangers and four sheriff's office reserve deputies).  Two
dozen citations were issued for a variety of violations, including minor
possession of alcohol and unsafe operation.  About 6,000 people attended the
event.  [K. Lee, WHSA, 5/3]</p>

93-254 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search</p>

<p>Around 7:30 p.m. on May 9th, the park was notified that two men - G.R.
and B.L., both in their mid-20s - had hiked into the dunes
and had not returned.  They were wearing only shorts and had neither shoes
nor water.  The weather during the night was clear, with temperatures in the
upper 30s and light winds.  Adjacent agencies were notified, and attraction
efforts were conducted until a half hour past midnight.  Search efforts were
then suspended until 5:30 a.m. the following morning.  The New Mexico state
police began searching for the pair with ground searchers and two military
helicopters.  Just before 11 a.m., G.R. and B.L. walked into RATSCAT,
a secure military facility on the White Sands missile range north of the
park.  They said that they'd walked southwest for about an hour after
entering the dunes, then walked north for two hours, missing the Heart of
the Dunes drive.  During the night, they dug a pit, placed brush around it
to break the wind, and started a small fire to keep warm.  They spotted the
RATSCAT facility at daybreak and walked to it.  The RATSCAT staff provided
food and water and treated both men's cut and sore feet.  Other than being
very tired, both men were in good condition.  [Bob Appling, CR, WHSA, 5/12]</p>

93-264 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search and Rescue</p>

<p>Just before noon on May 27th, the park received a report that 15-year-old
J.T. was missing.  J.T. was barefoot and wearing a T-shirt,
shorts and a baseball cap; she had no water, and was overdue for medication
for hyperactivity, without which she was subject to increased disorientation
and agitation.  J.T. had last been seen heading north into the Heart of
the Sands.  A search was begun within minutes.  J.T. was spotted about a
mile and a half north of the picnic area, but soon disappeared.  Rangers
found numerous tracks and followed them north; by 2 p.m., however, they
could no longer track her, and summoned a helicopter.  Rangers on board the
Army helicopter which responded searched the northeast section of the park
and found J.T. just before 3 p.m.  She was found approximately three miles
north of her last seen location, but had walked an estimated eight to ten
miles in an attempt to return to her group.  She was very thirsty,
disoriented and confused, but otherwise in good condition.  Ranger Kathy Lee
administered medications and calmed J.T. down until she was transported
back by helicopter.  [Bob Appling, CR, WHSA, 5/27]</p>

<p><br>Friday, July 16, 1993<br>
93-490 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search</p>

<p>G.L. and P.C., both 19, became lost while looking for
their dog around 9:30 p.m. on July 14th.  A patrol ranger found their car
parked with the doors open, the key in the ignition and money lying on the
front seat.  A search was begun on the morning of the 15th, but searchers
were unable to find any tracks because of the rain which fell overnight. 
While conducting the search, the park received notification from Holloman
Air Force Base that the two young men had wandered into a secure area and
were being held pending a ranger's arrival.  Both men were tired but
otherwise in good condition.  [Bob Appling, CR, WHSA, 7/15]</p>

<p><br>Tuesday, September 21, 1993<br>
93-716 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Special Event</p>

<p>On September 18th and 19th, portions of the White Sands/Alamogordo hot air
balloon festival were held in the park.  An event known as a "Moon Glow" was
held on Saturday evening.  By 8 p.m., over 8,000 visitors had arrived in the
park, and a three-mile-long line of cars was waiting to enter.  The event
had to be canceled, however, due to strong winds blowing the tethered
balloons over.  It took about three hours to clear the area of the 2,000+
vehicles parked there.  A dawn ascent by over 40 balloons on Sunday morning
drew several thousand visitors.  All balloons ascended without incident, but
landed on U.S. Highway 70 on the park's southern boundary, blocking all four
lanes intermittently for over two hours.  Two teenagers who were part of a
balloon crew followed the balloons into the dunes, but failed to return to
the staging area.  A search was begun; the teenagers walked out two hours
later.  The entire event was managed under ICS.  [Bob Appling, CR, WHSA,

93-747 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Aircraft Accident</p>

<p>A military contract helicopter made a hard landing within the park near Lake
Lucero around 6 p.m. on September 28th.  The helicopter's crew was in the
process of retrieving an item that had landed within the park when the
incident occurred.  The helicopter's downdraft inflated the object's
parachute, which was then sucked into the main and tail rotors.  Neither the
pilot nor his two passengers - one of whom was ranger Fred Harmon - were
hurt, but did have to make a three-hour moonlit walk to get to a highway. 
The helicopter could not be flown out because of the damage inflicted on its
tail section and rotors.  At the time of the report, mechanics were checking
it to see if it could be repaired for a short flight to a nearby road or
whether it will have to be lifted out.  [Bob Appling, CR, WHSA, 10/1]</p>

<p><br>Monday, March 14, 1994<br>
94-116 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search</p>

<p>On March 12th, M.H. of Fort Worth, Texas, became disoriented
during a sand storm while hiking in the park and became lost.  M.H. had
planned his visit to the park to coincide with the passage of a major
frontal system in order to photograph the dunes and clouds.  He left his
vehicle at 2 p.m. and hiked several miles into the dunes.  When the front
passed, blowing sand obscured the surrounding mountains, and M.H. became
disoriented.  A search was begun when rangers closing the park found
M.H.'s vehicle but were unable to find him.  Due to rapidly falling
temperatures, high winds, and winter storm warnings, limited efforts were
continued throughout the night.  M.H. eventually walked out to a highway
west of the park visitor center, where he was found by a passing county
deputy at 3:30 a.m.  M.H. was in very good condition considering what
he'd been through.  It's estimated that he'd walked over 20 miles in blowing
sand with north winds between 25 and 35 mph and temperatures near freezing.

94-216 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Special Event</p>

<p>Due to weather disturbances along most of the path of Tuesday's annular
solar eclipse and the high altitude and desert climate of the park, White
Sands found itself hosting over 300 astronomers, who set up telescopes,
cameras and video recorders at the visitor center and in the dunes.  A local
astronomy club provided a live feed to a video projector for visitor
viewing.  Astronomers from Belgium, England, Canada, Mexico and from
throughout the United Sates visited White Sands for the event.  [Bob

95-439 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Pursuit</p>

<p>On July 17th, the park received an advisory to be on the lookout for a black
Jeep Cherokee with two juveniles on board - a 14-year-old girl and a 17-year-
old boy - who were believed to be heading to the park from east Texas.  The
Jeep had been taken without permission from the boy's father, and the girl was
entered in NCIC as a runaway.  The next day, ranger Maijala spotted and
attempted to stop a Jeep matching that description which was speeding on a park
road.  The driver of the Jeep refused to stop, however, and a chase ensued
which reached speeds of 90 to 100 mph.  Pursuing rangers Maijala and Denton
relayed information ahead to Las Cruces and state police and broke off the
chase.  About 45 minutes and 50 miles later, a Las Cruces officer stopped the
Jeep, which was doing 81 mph in a 55 mph zone.  The  Jeep bore phony license
plates, but the runaway's identity was confirmed through NCIC.  The 17-year-
old, an adult under Texas law, was charged with speeding and fictitious tag
violations by Las Cruces officers and with reckless driving by rangers.  The
girl was held in detention until her parents could fly from east Texas the next
day to pick her up.  The driver and Jeep were held until the boy's parents
could arrive.  The girl's parents, having just returned from a family vacation
in California, were convinced that the romantically involved youths were trying
to return to California.  [Kathy Denton, Acting CR, WHSA]</p>

95-772 - White Sands (New Mexico) - Search and Rescue</p>

<p>Two hikers taking sunset photographs in the park failed to return to the
vehicle by park closing time on the evening of December 5th.  Ranger Kathy
Denton, assisted by resident volunteers, began a search for the two men.  After
tracking them for two-and-a-half hours, it became apparent that they were
heading away from the road and into a remote, roadless desert.  Winds were
increasing, and temperatures dropped to a low of 37 degrees.  Ranger Barry
Maijala joined the search and coordinated patrols of the park's perimeters with
military police from the adjacent base.  The two men appeared to be heading
towards an area known to be littered with unexploded military ordnance. 
Maijala located the two hikers just after 10 p.m. as they were crossing the
park boundary into that area.  One of the men wore hiking shorts; both were
dressed lightly, with no water, food or extra clothing.  Although they were in
good condition and unharmed, they were extremely thirsty and tired.  The two
men had carried a tripod and heavy camera gear through 13 miles of soft sand
after becoming disoriented and discovering that their compass was
malfunctioning.  They were still five miles from the nearest installation when
they were found.  The hikers were in good physical condition and travelled
faster than average, which contributed to the urgency of the search.  [Kathy
Denton/Barry Maijala, WHSA]</p>

97-399 - White Sands NM (NM) - Rescue</p>

<p>On the morning of Sunday, July 6th, members of a group that had camped
illegally in the park the previous night reported that one of their number -
N.W., 19 - was missing.  He'd last been seen asking directions to the
road.  Since afternoon temperatures were in the mid-90s, the park sought
assistance from the 48th Rescue Squadron at Holloman AFB.  Ranger Jonathan
Brotzman worked from the helicopter, while ranger Paul Jones and a Border
Patrol agent followed N.W.'s windblown tracks.  They found that he had
abandoned his guitar, shoes and a backpack containing a water bottle.  N.W.
was found in the early evening and transported to a hospital for medical
attention.  He was given seven bags of intravenous fluids at the hospital as
treatment for severe dehydration and sun exposure.  [Nancy Wizner, CR, WHSA,

99-737 - White Sands NM (NM) - Missile Landing; HazMat Spill</p>

<p>A Lance missile being tested on the nearby White Sands Missile Range went 
awry and crashed in a remote area of the park earlier this week. The 
liquid-fueled missile, which is about 20 feet long and three feet wide, 
was travelling at supersonic speed when it struck and buried itself at an 
undetermined depth in an alkali flat. A crater about 25 feet in diameter 
resulted and quickly filled with water due to the high water table. 
Hazardous materials are present. Park and Army personnel are working on 
mitigation and compliance efforts. [Intermountain Morning Line, 12/22]</p>

00-518 - White Sands NP (NM) - Search and Rescue</p>

<p>On August 21st, ranger Garry Olson was notified of an overdue hiker in 
the Alkali Flats area. Ranger Greg Kouns and facility manager John 
Ford also responded. N.R., 18, of Alpharetta, Georgia, had not 
been seen for five hours. The temperature at the time was 97 degrees, 
and N.R. reportedly had only a quart of water with her. The area was 
searched by foot and ATV, but no sign of her was detected. An Army 
helicopter from White Sands Missile Range picked up Olson and began an 
air search. N.R. was spotted about six miles from the trailhead, 
walking toward the lights of a military facility outside of the park. 
She was moderately dehydrated, but otherwise in good condition. [Cliff

01-195 - White Sands NM (NM) - Suicide</p>

<p>On the evening of May 5th, park visitors told ranger Joel Barnett that 
they'd come upon what appeared to be a dead man on the top of a dune 
south of the Alkali Flats trailhead. Upon arrival, Barnett found the 
body of a 22-year-old Florida man. He had died from a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound; a 12-gauge shotgun was found at his feet. Investigation 
led to the discovery that the man had been depressed and had been 
reported missing two days previously by his roommate, who had found a 
suicide note. A second suicide note was found in his nearby vehicle. 
The investigation is being handled by chief ranger Cliff Spencer and 
the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. [Cliff Spencer, CR,

02-351 - White Sands NM (NM) - Missile Accident</p>

<p>An errant missile landed within the park's cooperative use area, which
is closed to visitors, around 8 a.m. on the morning of August 2nd. The
point of impact was about 15 miles from the main visitor area. The park
was under a scheduled closure at the time of the accident, so there was
never any danger to visitors or staff. The missile was a drone used for
targeting missions and contained a hydrazine propellant. It veered off
its intended course, so was given a self-destruct order by controllers.
The impact left a six-foot diameter crater in the ground. A hazmat crew
from White Sands Missile Range flew to the crater on August 2nd to take
air and water samples and assess the site. Test results are expected
shortly. Cleanup and rehabilitation of the site will be coordinated with
the military and the state's department of the environment. [Cliff

02-467 - White Sands National Monument (NM) - Search for Missing Visitor</p>

<p>While closing the park on September 9, a ranger found a rental car in
an area closed to camping. He searched the area for more than two hours,
but was not able to find the driver. Subsequent investigation revealed
that the car had been rented to K.F., a 29-year-old Japanese
citizen. A more intensive search was begun the next day, employing
helicopters from the nearby White Sands Missile Range and ground
searchers skilled in sign-cutting techniques. No sign of the visitor was
found. Search operations continued until Saturday, September 14, at
which point they were suspended for lack of clues. Search managers
utilized dog teams, a Customs airplane equipped with an infrared camera,
helicopters, ATV's, mounted riders, six three-person ground teams,
members of the New Mexico state police SAR team, and 45 airmen from
Holloman AFB. K.F.'s parents and sister were flown to the U.S. by
their son's employer, Sumikin Bussan International Corporation, but have
since returned to Tokyo. The vehicle has been impounded and is being
processed for clues. A missing persons report has been posted on NCIC.

02-467 - White Sands National Monument (NM) - Follow-up on Search for Missing Visitor</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 21, two hikers discovered the body of a man
tentatively identified as that of K.F., 29, a Japanese citizen
who became lost in the park on September 9 or 10. He was found just over
a mile southeast of Dunes Drive and nearly two miles south of his
vehicle and the primary search area. The state medical investigator will
conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death and verify his
identity. A fanny pack with various documents in K.F.'s name was found
nearby. There was no evidence of foul play in the area where his remains
were found.  [Submitted by Cliff Spencer, Chief Ranger, White

Crash of Unmanned Aircraft</p>

<p>On February 11, an unmanned QF-4 drone crashed inside the park. The
drone, which is an F-4 fighter jet modified for remote flight, crashed
nine miles from headquarters in a remote section of the park. There were
no injuries. The aircraft was on final approach to Holloman AFB when it
suddenly veered right and sharply down. The drone was being used as a
target for missile systems being tested on White Sands Missile Range.
Several motorists observed the crash from US Highway 70, and at least
one videotaped the aftermath. The videotape was acquired by Air Force
personnel, but will be returned to its owner following analysis. Ranger
Garry Olson and cultural resource specialist Diane White were flown to
the scene aboard an Army helicopter to assess the wreckage. It appears
that the explosives package aboard the jet detonated prior to impact, as
is supposed to occur when controllers lose contact with the plane.
Cleanup of the site will begin once the area is declared safe and the
investigation is completed. A joint investigation will be conducted by
Holloman AFB and White Sands Missile Range. <br>[Submitted by Cliff

Pipe Bomb Found in Park</p>

<p>Two park visitors came upon what appeared to be a suspicious object
beneath a bush in the dune area on the afternoon of August 3rd. They
reported their find to rangers Joel Barnett and Jill Jaworski, who found
the object and determined that it was a pipe with end caps. They
immediately cleared the area and notified an explosive ordnance disposal
team from Fort Bliss. The EOD team rendered the device safe. It was
found to contain an explosive charge and shrapnel. ATF agents and
rangers are investigating. No suspects or motives have yet been
identified. <br>[Submitted by Cliff Spencer, Chief Ranger]</p>

Facilities Closed Due To Extensive Flooding</p>

<p>Record-breaking rainfall has flooded much of the white sands dune field. Two
miles of the scenic eight-mile Dunes Drive are underwater and closed to
vehicular traffic. The park's picnic areas, nature center and backcountry trails
are in the flooded area and are also temporarily closed. The flooding began with
9 inches of rain in August, which is more than double the park's previous record
for monthly rainfall. More rain in September and October expanded the flooded
area, with as much as 16 inches of standing water on roads and parking areas.
Because the dune field is at the bottom of a basin, the water cannot drain away.
Only evaporation will remove the water, and, with cooler fall and winter
temperatures, parts of the dune field will likely remain flooded for many weeks.
Assuming no more rain exacerbates the problem, the park will reopen parts of the
road and picnic areas as they dry up. [John Mangimeli, Chief of
Interpretation]</p>

Woman Dies While Hiking Alkali Flat Trail</p>

<p>A 23-year old woman from Sheldon, Iowa, died yesterday
while hiking the Alkali Flat Trail. E.H. was hiking with a
friend when she began experiencing symptoms of distress. E.H.'s friend
quickly hiked back to the trailhead to retrieve additional water and ice
from their car and called 911 from her cell phone around 1 p.m. When the
friend returned to the scene, she found E.H. unconscious and began CPR.
Upon receiving the 911 call, rangers hike about a half mile to her
location on the trail and continued CPR. Paramedics from Alamo West
Volunteer Fire Department also responded and provided assistance, but
were unable to revive her. The Alkali Flat Trail is a five-mile loop
trail traversing the park's dunes. The high temperature yesterday was
near 100 degrees. Hikers are advised to be prepared for extreme
temperatures and bring at least one gallon of water per person,
sunglasses, sunscreen, and high energy snacks. Rangers are investigating
the incident. The cause of death is being investigated by the New Mexico
Office of the Medical Investigator. [Becky Wiles, Chief of

Two Lost Hikers Rescued Through Interagency SAR</p>

<p>Early on the morning of August 15th, rangers received a
report of two hikers who had been lost within the sand dunes overnight.
They had planned on camping overnight on Sunday, but became disoriented
while returning to their backcountry camp site. The park and Alamo West
Volunteer Search and Rescue began search operations under a unified
command, with Holloman Air Force Base providing an HYPERLINK
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAV" unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) to help with the search effort. With the help of
the UAV, rangers were able to narrow the search area to within a quarter
mile of where the lost hikers were eventually found. An Army air search
and rescue unit out of White Sands Missile Range provided additional air
support and spotted the lost hikers just after 11 a.m. The pair, who had
been lost for over 12 hours, were found in the dune field more than
eight miles from where they had left their car. Both were treated for
dehydration and transported to Gerald Champion Hospital in Alamogordo.
The park's military and community partners frequently provide critical
air support for rescue operations, which greatly helps the success of
rescue operations in the difficult terrain. [Joe Hughes, Acting Chief
Ranger]</p>

Newly Engaged Couple Found By Interagency Searchers</p>

<p>On the afternoon of Monday, January 9th, the park learned
that two visitors who had been hiking within the dunes since noon were
lost and unable to find their way out. R.V. and K.R.,
both of Oklahoma, left to go hiking with their three dogs,
Stitch, Suzy, and Griswald. After finding a suitably beautiful spot
within the dunes, R.V. proposed to K.R. The newly engaged
couple than attempted to hike back to their car, but were unable to find
their way back. Rather than continue to wander becoming more lost, they
contacted a cousin via cell phone and requested that help be sent. An
interagency effort was begun that involved the NPS, the Alamo West
Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S.
Army. While two Army Rescue Blackhawk helicopters were en route from
Fort Bliss, approximately an hour away, Holloman Air Force base diverted
an F-22 Raptor from a training mission to the search effort. The pilot
of the Raptor was able to positively identify the couple with their
three dogs. Two Air Force drones were also tasked, which were able to
relay specific coordinates and monitor the lost hiker's location and
movement from the air while the Army helicopters were en route. The
hikers and their dogs were transported by the Army Blackhawks out of the
dunes to the command post, where they were examined by NPS and Alamo
West EMS for exposure to the below freezing nighttime temperatures.
K.R. accepted R.V.'s marriage proposal. The newly engaged couple
invited the Blackhawk crew to the wedding. The search effort was greatly
aided by the assistance of the military aircraft, which utilized night
vision and infrared equipment to safely locate the hikers after
nightfall. Ranger Kelly Roche acted as IC. [Becky Wiles, Acting

Autistic Teenager Found After Overnight Search</p>

<p>An autistic teenager was found by the crew of an Air Force
Blackhawk helicopter on Monday morning after a 15-hour search. The
search was begun for the 15-year-old boy around dusk on Sunday after he
wandered away from his family during a visit to the park. Over 100
searchers were involved in the all-night operation, which was managed
under a unified command and involved the NPS, Air Force, Army, Border
Patrol, New Mexico Search and Rescue, New Mexico State Police, and Alamo
West Volunteer Fire and Rescue. The incident began when members of an
extended family group from El Paso who had spent the afternoon sledding
and picnicking in the park realized that the teen was not with them.
They searched for him for about an hour before contacting rangers, who
conducted an unsuccessful hasty search of the area. The search was
quickly expanded and given high priority due to the teen's autism,
impending darkness, and weather. Canine units, ATV searchers, aircraft,
and ground personnel were deployed during the night. At first light,
additional resources were utilized to expand the operation, including
three helicopters (two from the Border Patrol and a Blackhawk helicopter
from Kirtland AFB) and several canine units (teams from Holloman AFB,
New Mexico Search and Rescue, and the Border Patrol). Ground searchers,
all-terrain vehicles, and equestrian teams from all previously listed
agencies also supported this complex search and rescue operation. At
10:15 am, personnel in the Blackhawk spotted the teenager walking in the
dunes about six miles from the point where he'd last been seen. He was
found to be in good health and spirits. The boy was flown to the command
post and reunited with his family. The missing teen was excited to have
a helicopter ride and asked one of the Blackhawk crewmen for his patch.
The crewman ripped the patch off his shoulder and handed it to the
rescued teen. The teen's family was extremely grateful and thanked
everyone who was involved with bringing their son home. [Becky Wiles,

Hikers In Distress Saved Through Quick EMS Response</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 24th, rangers responded to a 911 report of
two hikers suffering from heat exhaustion at milepost three on the
Alkali Flat Loop Trail. A father, 66, and his daughter, 22, left to hike
the Alkali Flat Loop at approximately 8:30 a.m.; just before noon, they
made the 911 call, reporting that they were completely out of water and
unable to complete their hike.</p>

<p>Rangers, Alamo West Volunteer Fire and Rescue personnel,
and paramedics responded immediately. Ranger Joe Salvini hiked quickly
up the trail to the hikers. Ranger Joshua Wright also responded with
additional water and cooling aids. Alamo West responded with paramedics
utilizing their EMS UTV from the opposite direction at the trailhead.
When Salvini reached milepost three, he was unable to find the lost
hikers, who had climbed to the top of a dune. While Salvini was
searching the immediate area for them, the father called again and
reported that his daughter was having difficulty breathing. Salvini
located them and began EMS treatment. Wright, after climbing to the top
of a large dune, was able to visually locate Salvini and the hikers. He
then ran three miles cross country to cut the loop and actually arrived
on scene before the paramedics driving the UTV. The paramedics provided
advanced life support. The hikers were transported back to their
vehicle, where they declined further treatment. Kelly Roche was IC.

Two Visitors Rescued In Separate Incidents</p>

<p>Park staff, supported by personnel from other agencies,
were involved in two rescues earlier this week - one on Sunday and the
other on Monday. On the afternoon of Sunday, April 29th, Otero County
dispatch received a report of a park visitor with a back injury who was
in need of help. The 32-year-old woman was walking down a sand dune when
she tripped and fell, rolled down the dune, and landed on a section of
hard-packed playa. Rangers Luke Hayden, Ryan Moore and Kelly Roche
responded and provided EMS care until Alamo West EMS and American
Medical Response (AMR) arrived with paramedics and took over. AMR
transported the woman to a local hospital, where she received additional
care and later was transported to an El Paso, Texas, hospital for
treatment of a dislocated hip. On the following afternoon, Otero County
dispatch received a 911 call from a 25-year-old hiker who was lost in
the dunes. He'd left his vehicle around 10 a.m. and hiked about 14 miles
barefoot. He said that he hiked cross country when he realized he was
lost and out of water and provided coordinates from his smart phone's
GPS application. Rangers and Alamo West SAR personnel responded to the
coordinates that were provided, but found no sign of the lost hiker, He
was contacted again by cell phone. Using the hiker's description of the
unique vegetation and distant structures he could see, David Bustos, the
park's chief of resources, was able to hone in on the location and find
the hiker's footprints. He was located about eight miles from his car in
the parabolic dunes along the monument's remote northern boundary. He
was treated in the field for blisters and transported by UTV back to the
command post, where he was assessed and released. The search was managed
under a unified command with NPS and Alamo West SAR. The park, which has
limited staff, expressed its appreciation for the support received
through their partnerships with Alamo West, American Medical Response,
Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range. [Kelly Roche,

Unmanned Military Drone Crashes In Park</p>

<p>An unmanned QF-4 drone from Holloman Air Force Base
crashed in the park on the morning of Friday, February 7th. No one was
injured. QF-4 drones are converted F-4 Phantom fighter jets.</p>

<p>Dunes Drive was closed while staff from the base and from
White Sands Missile Range conducted an investigation at the crash site.
Access to the sand dunes, picnic areas and hiking trails was restricted
until the investigation and cleanup could be concluded.</p>

<p>The park routinely supports missile tests conducted by
White Sands Missile Range. It is common practice to close Dunes Drive as
a precautionary measure to ensure public safety during missile tests
when flight paths include airspace over the monument. The closure of
Dunes Drive before last Friday's missile test ensured that no injuries
resulted from this accident.</p>

Hiker's Death Attributed To Heat Exposure</p>

<p>A 70-year-old German visitor who died on the Alkali Flat Trail on
June 8th likely succumbed to heat exposure.</p>

<p>The park received a call for help around 4 p.m. that day. Responding
rangers found the body of Peter Cramer less than a mile from the
trailhead. New Mexico State Police officers assisted rangers and are
working with them on the investigation into the cause of his death.</p>

<p>Rangers at White Sands say Saturday's temperatures reached 99
degrees. Cramer and his wife were hiking the trail together, but she
opted to return to their car because of the heat. When he failed to
return, she notified the park.</p>

<p>In 2015, a French couple visiting the park died along the trail in
extreme heat. Their nine-year-old son survived and was able to call for
help.</p>

Trump Group Being Investigated For Theft Of Park Sand</p>

<p>The New Mexico group Cowboys for Trump is facing criticism after
members brought iconic gypsum sands from the park to the annual
Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in Washington, a violation of federal
law.</p>

<p>The group brought four "big plastic bins" of the sand to the event.
