The FBI and the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS) are currently investigating the disappearance of <b>RUBÉN FIGUEROA ALCOCER</b>.
<p></p>
On Monday, May 30, 1966, at approximately 7:00 pm, 74-year old RUBÉN FIGUEROA ALCOCER was abducted in the sierra of the Costa Grande 
region of Guerrero. He had been travelling in the Guerrero region as part of his electoral campaign for state governorship, and 
had been in the midst of negotiations with the revolutionary guerilla organization known as the Party of the Poor (PDLP). He has 
since been nominated as a candidate for governor of Guerrero in the weeks since his kidnapping. Mexican authorities suspect Lucio 
Cabañas and the PDLP to be responsible for FIGUEROA’s disappearance, and have advised local residents to report any revolutionary 
activity to state officials as soon as possible.
</p><p>
FIGUEROA is an older Hispanic male, 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighs approximately 170 pounds. He has a light complexion, short 
dark brown hair, and a scar above his left eye. He was wearing a white collared shirt, blue jeans and brownish-yellow boots 
at the time of his disappearance.
